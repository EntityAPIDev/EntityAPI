EntityAPI
=========

A Bukkit API that enables you to easily control your own custom entities

Current code base only supports 1.7.2. We will be updating to the latest Minecraft version once we are satisfied with our API.

In meanwhile you can listen to this song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6KkF56Cr90 *cough*

And nope, there's currently no JavaDocs or any sort of documentation on the API...yet...

Todo:
=====

Stuff that needs to be done or is still unfinished (this list may be incomplete):
- API docs
- Player entity
- Pathfinding
- Game registry
- Modifications to spawning and despawning to work with NMS entity registration
